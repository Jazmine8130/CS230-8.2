Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a company that already had a successful game on Andriod devices and wanted to expand their game to other platform. 


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Explainging the design plan was one of the best parts of the the document. Showing how each of the classes would work together to how they each would give and take from each other was the strongest point. 


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Relying on the UML and the plan helped with developing the code. I was able to cross things off the UML as they were created. As well, when it came to inheritance and other attributes, the plan made it very easy to see which parts should be incorporated where. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve the evaluations section of the document. There was more informa tion for some sections than others. I would have also included sources to facilitate the points i was trying to make with each section. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Since there would be many different platforms for the game to be played on, we needed to make sure that the game was able to be played on all of the one requested by the cleint. Also, the users needs are important since if they do not like the way the software looks or acts, it could turn them away. If the software is too difficult to learn, then it will not be used.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I would definately use the design document again. There was a lot of great organization to help keep the flow of the program linear and easy to follow. I would also study the UML design again to ensure that all the parts are there.
